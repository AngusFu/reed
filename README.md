"Man is but a reed, the most feeble thing in nature, but he is a thinking reed".

## TODO

<del>
Reed got severe problem with rxjs when bundling all `@angular` modules as "vender". A solution is on the way to my mind. More investigation & experiments are needed. Hope it would get solved soon.

## Ideas

Use [System.js](http://plnkr.co/edit/HDnJrb3TvSAYgoyRFl2S) just for DEV?

Or check [angular2-webpack-starter](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter)?

Take a look at [angular2-rollup-starter](https://github.com/AngusFu/angular2-rollup-starter). To be honest, it'a a lot better than this.
