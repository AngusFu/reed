Redd got severe problem with rxjs when bundling all `@angular` modules as "vender". A solution is on the way to my mind...

Maybe it's time to change my mind and [turn to System.js](http://plnkr.co/edit/HDnJrb3TvSAYgoyRFl2S) just for DEV?

Or check [angular2-webpack-starter](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter)?

More investigation & experiments are needed. Hope it would get solved soon.
